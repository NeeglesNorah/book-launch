# 🔐 Secure Book Download - Setup Complete!

## What Was Done

Your book is now **fully protected** and can ONLY be downloaded through the secure download page with a valid token.

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ **Moved PDF to Private Folder**
   - From: `public/Living-and-Ageing-Gracefully-Book.pdf` (Anyone could access)
   - To: `private/Living-and-Ageing-Gracefully-Book.pdf` (Fully protected)

2. ✅ **Created Protected API Endpoint**
   - New file: `api/download-book.ts`
   - Validates token before serving file
   - Only `ChunuLegacy2025` token works

3. ✅ **Updated Download Component**
   - Now fetches from `/api/download-book?token=XXX`
   - Downloads as blob for security
   - Better error handling

4. ✅ **Updated Configuration**
   - Added `@vercel/node` package
   - Updated `vercel.json` for API routing
   - Created API tsconfig

## How It Works Now

### Before (Insecure):
```
❌ Anyone could visit: https://chunulegacy.com/Living-and-Ageing-Gracefully-Book.pdf
❌ Direct access to PDF
```

### After (Secure):
```
✅ PDF is in private folder - NOT publicly accessible
✅ Must go through: /api/download-book?token=ChunuLegacy2025
✅ API validates token before serving file
✅ Wrong token = Error 403 (Forbidden)
✅ No token = Error 403 (Forbidden)
```

## Testing

### ❌ This Will NOT Work (Protected):
```
https://chunulegacy.com/Living-and-Ageing-Gracefully-Book.pdf
https://chunulegacy.com/private/Living-and-Ageing-Gracefully-Book.pdf
https://chunulegacy.com/api/download-book (no token)
https://chunulegacy.com/api/download-book?token=wrong
```

### ✅ This WILL Work (Secured):
```
https://chunulegacy.com/download-book?token=ChunuLegacy2025
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install New Package:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then visit: `http://localhost:3012/download-book?token=ChunuLegacy2025`

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add secure book download with API protection"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify on Production:**
   - Try: `https://chunulegacy.com/Living-and-Ageing-Gracefully-Book.pdf` → Should fail
   - Try: `https://chunulegacy.com/download-book?token=ChunuLegacy2025` → Should work
